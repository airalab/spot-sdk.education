# Become a certified Spot developer
In may we will offer developers educational program based on using spot under robonomics control to learn Boston dynamics sdk and get certificate with parachain evidence in form of data log of leasing spot for each lesson.

## The training program

Our educational program based on [Boston Dynamics SDK documantation](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/). Lesson prepared by phd and masted degrees in robotics at [Laboratory of Multi-Agent Systems in Smart Cities and Industry 4.0, ITMO University, Saint Petersburg](https://multi-agent.io).

* **Lesson 1: Spot’s API over a network connection.** Understanding networking protocols is critical to debugging issues and creating a robust, high-performant application. 
* **Lesson 2: Spot base Services.** These services include authentication, service discovery, and time synchronization. Many applications will use the Base Services when starting up, and before using services higher in the stack such as Robot State, Robot Commands, and Autonomy.
* **Lesson 3: Developing API Services.** In order to expand the capabilities of Spot it may be necessary to stand up services beyond the onboard services that ship with Spot. Additional services may enable collection of data from third party sensors, trigger actions outside of the robot, or process collected data in real time.
* **Lesson 4: Autonomy services.** The Spot SDK includes APIs, client libraries, and examples that support the development of autonomous navigation behaviors for the Spot robot. For robot operators, autonomous navigation is accessed using the Autowalk feature on the robot’s controller tablet. Operators use Autowalk to record and play back missions. Likewise, API callbacks and other actions can be added to waypoints during map recording.
* **Lesson 5: Spot Data.** This lesson describes various concepts on how data is captured, stored and retrieved in Spot services.
